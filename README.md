## Introduction
FSMs, an important category of sequential circuits, are used frequently in designing digital systems. From the daily used electronic machines to the complex digital systems, FSMs are used everywhere. For example, in a station the vending machine which dispatches ticket uses a simple FSM. In the complex digital systems the controlling part is most of the times implemented using FSMs.

FSMs are generally of two types.

MEALY Machine: MEALY circuits are named after G. H, Mealy, one of the leading personalities in designing digital systems. The basic property of Mealy circuits is that the output is a function of the present input conditions and the present state (PS) of the circuit.
MOORE Machine: MOORE circuits are named after E. F. Moore, another leading personality in designing digital systems. The basic property of Moore circuits is that the output is strictly a function of the present state (PS) of the circuit.
